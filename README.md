# **Hey there, I'm Rachel ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable infrastructure and real-time applications. I specialize in creating developer tools that solve real problems and help teams build better software faster. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring Chicago and learning about the latest in the world of 1's and 0's.

**ðŸš€ Pendulum BaaS**

On a team of 3 engineers, I co-created **Pendulum**, a comprehensive self-hosted Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that gives developers extensive features with complete data ownership. Pendulum is designed for teams who want real-time capabilities and rapid development without vendor lock-in.

**Key Features:**
- **Self-hosted & MongoDB-native** - Deploy to your own AWS infrastructure
- **Real-time by default** - All database changes automatically push to subscribed clients via Server-Sent Events
- **Complete solution** - Backend services, CLI, SDK, and admin dashboard included
- **AWS-optimized** - One-command deployment using CDK infrastructure as code
- **Role-based permissions** - Granular CRUD control with document ownership

*Technologies Used - TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Docker, AWS (ECS Fargate, DocumentDB, ALB, VPC), AWS CDK, React*
